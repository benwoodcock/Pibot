begin

turn on photo resistor 
if its dark turn on inferred lights

ultrasonic sensor emits signal
turn ultrasonic sensor 90 to the left 
turn ultrasonic sensor 180 to the right
repeat above

check temperature from sensor one
if temperature is hot then turn on fan

both motors turn on (moves wheels)

calculate distance from the ultra sonic sensor 
check if the distance is less than 30cm
if distance is less than 30cm then stop one motor

check temperature from sensor one
if temperature is hot then turn on fan


end
