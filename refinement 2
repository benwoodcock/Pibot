photo resistor HIGH
calculate the light in the room
if the room is dark then 
inferred HIGH
else room is light then
inferred LOW 

ultrasonic sensor emits signal
activate trigger, send the message
get the message back
calculate the time
calculate distance =  speed * time
check if less than 30

turn ultrasonic sensor 90 to the left 
activate trigger, send the message
get the message back
calculate the time
calculate distance =  speed * time
check if less than 30

turn ultrasonic sensor 180 to the right
activate trigger, send the message
get the message back
calculate the time
calculate distance =  speed * time
check if less than 30

temperature sensor one HIGH
calculate temperature
if temperature is more than 32 degress then 
fan HIGH

if distance is less than 30 then
Motor one HIGH
Motor two HIGH

else 
Motor one HIGH
Motor two LOW
(stop after 1.5 seconds)

turn ultrasonic sensor 180 to the right
activate trigger, send the message
get the message back
calculate the time
calculate distance =  speed * time
check if less than 30
check if the distance is less than 30cm

turn ultrasonic sensor 180 to the left
activate trigger, send the message
get the message back
calculate the time
calculate distance =  speed * time
check if less than 30
check if the distance is less than 30cm

if distance is less than 30cm then 
Motor one HIGH
Motor two LOW
(stop after 1.5 seconds)

else
Motor one HIGH
Motor two HIGH

check temperature from sensor one
temperature sensor one HIGH
calculate temperature
if temperature is more than 32 degress then 
fan HIGH
